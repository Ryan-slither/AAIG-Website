export const introText = "Autonomous systems learn with different types of data, such as text and images, to create deeper understanding and improve predictions in their environments. These types of systems can be applied in fields such as driver monitoring systems and medical diagnostics. However, a significant problem that is often encountered is inconsistent data. This results in concept drift, which is when a system’s ability to make accurate predictions slowly decreases because reality no longer follows the patterns the system learned in its training data. The focus of this model design revolves around adapting its learning rate and fusion rate, or the weight it places on different modalities to make decisions, to minimize and resolve concept drift. It accomplishes this by detecting changes in the model’s error rates and adjusting the learning and fusion rate until the error is bounded. This results in stability in the model’s error rate when drift is continuous and a convergence to zero once the drift ceases."
export const systemDesign = "The above is a figure of the system design. As you can see, image and text data flow into a fusion block, and using the computed fusion rate, it combines the images and text into a representation space of the data, prioritizing one over the other depending on the weights. This is then fed into the prediction module which classifies the data and evaluates the performance of the model. The drift detection module receives the classification result and, based on historical data and statistical distribution tracking, detects possible drift and alerts the Lyapunov controller to adjust learning or fusion rates to accommodate for the inconsistent data. Finally, the learning and fusion rates are shared with the drift detection module and multimodal fusion block to prepare for the next cycle, and the process continues."
export const liveFig2 = "The first figure demonstrates the system's ability to maintain stability in error rates under periods of heavy concept drift."
export const liveFig3 = "The second figure reveals how the system addresses specific data issues with text or images by adjusting its own learning and fusion rates."
export const conclusion = "Overall, the LS-OGD framework provides a design that uses dynamic adjustments for systems operating with different modalities to bound and eventually eliminate error. It ensures more consistent performance and creates a foundation for more trustworthy AI, allowing for extensions into further nonlinear models, deep architectures, and context-aware adaptation strategies."
