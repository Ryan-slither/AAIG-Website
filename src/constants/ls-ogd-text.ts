export const introText = "Autonomous systems leveraging multimodal learning combine data from different modalities, such as text and images, to create deeper understanding and predictions in their environments. These systems are used across real-world applications like driver monitoring systems and online platforms that handle diverse media types. However, a significant issue presents itself when these systems encounter inconsistent data, resulting in concept drift. Over time, the system or model may adapt to closely to this inconsistent data and will no longer be able to accomplish its purpose. Our design focuses on adapting the model's learning rate and fusion rate between different modalities to preserve its integrity. This is accomplished by detecting changes in the model's error rates and adjusting the learning and fusion rate to bound error. Lastly, a key part of this design is the use of Lyapunov Stability Analysis to maintain stability in the model's error rate during times of continuous drift and convergence to zero once the drift ceases."
export const systemDesign = "Above is a figure of the system design. As you can see, image and text data flow into a fusion block, and using the computed fusion rate, it creates a representation space of the weighted data. This is then fed into the prediction module which classifies the data and evaluates performance. The drift detection module receives the classification result and detects, based on historical data and statistical distribution tracking, alerts the Lyapunov controller to adjust learning or fusion rates to accommodate for the inconsistent or bad data. Finally, the learning and fusion rates are shared to the drift detection module and multimodal fusion block respectively, and the process continues."
export const liveFig2 = "The first figure demonstrates the system's ability to maintain stability in error rates under periods of heavy drift."
export const liveFig3 = "The second figure reveals how the system addresses specific modality issues by self-adjusting learning and fusion rates."
export const conclusion = "Overall, the LS-OGD framework provides a design to leverage dynamic adjustments for systems operating with different modalities to limit error rate. It ensures more consistent performance and creates a foundation for more trustworthy AI, allowing for extensions into further nonlinear models, deep architectures, and context-aware adaptation strategies."
